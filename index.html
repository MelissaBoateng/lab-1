  <h1>Autobiography</h1>
<p>My name is Melissa. Born in Ghana and I am 20 years old. Currently studying in Ashesi University.
    A computer science major. I live by the saying <strong>"God is within her, she would not fail"</strong>.
</p>
<p>My main belief in life is that everything should be in harmony and Peace. People have to keep balance in all spheres of life: society, family, work, friendship, and others. 
    Studying is my personal way to keep balance. Iâ€™m driven by my passion to visit all cities with a rich artistic history. I am very interested in humanities and would love to see a change in the world.</p>
